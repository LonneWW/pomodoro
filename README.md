  <p align="center">
    This project is the practical exam of the Javascript Basics start2impact University's course. </br>
    The task was to create a "counter" application where the user could increase or decrease the visible number by pressing one of the buttons.
     Since I often use the pomodoro technique to study, I thought it would be more interesting, challenging and generally useful to create a timer instead of a simple counter.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

I think most of its usage is self explanatory. </br>
Before you start the timer, you can increase and decrease the number of minutes using the +/- buttons. If you hold the Shift key (or, with devices without a keyboard, if the "shift" button is lightened up), you'll modify the number by tens. </br>
You also can choose to remove the ticking sound of the timer to better concentrate by clicking the stopwatch/bomb button, on the upper right of the screen. </br>
When you are ready, press the start button to start the timer and, if you ever need to reset it, press it again. </br>
At the and of the "pomodoro", a "Great job" alert will appear.

<!-- FLAWS -->
## Flaws

A little list of the site's flaws:
1. The layout is not responsive with every mobile/tablet devices. It's usable and effective, but not efficient.
2. The clicking sound is not synchronized with the decreasing seconds. I tried to make it that way, but since I couldn't, I thought it will be better to use an obviously desynchronized audio.
3. Switching browser window while the timer is running may cause some problems. Also, it doesn't notify you when it ends. You can ear the jingle at the end, but I think it's not enough.

<!-- UPDATES -->
## Updates

Here's a list of the updates and changes that I'd like to do in the future:
1. Making the site more customizable. Maybe like giving the possibility to choose a color theme, the jingle and things like that.
2. Giving the possibility to resize and pin the window at an angle of the screen to keep track of the time.
3. Giving the possibility to organize series of timers with different tasks (like a pomodoro for working and a 10 mins pause) and timer length.
4. Making the browser memorize those information to not lose changes or progress if the window is closed accidentally.
